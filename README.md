### Hi there!

I have loved computers since my 486 DOS PC, before the Internet. 

Later, the Web became the first place where I really developed by customizing "open source" Perl scripts under the `cgi-bin` folder.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/armandoneto) or my [personal website](https://armandoneto.com/).

#### Now

In 2023, I quit Red Hat to take a sabbatical and reevaluate my professional goals. 

#### Past
